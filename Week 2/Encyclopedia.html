      <h3>What is a fern?</h3>
      <p>A fern is a popular vascular plant that can be found both domesticated and in the wild!</p>
      <p>They are one of the <strong>oldest</strong> groups of plants that still exist today.</p>
      <p>They have been able to survive and live so long because they are able to reproduce at a super fast rate</p>
      <p>Each little leaf has a seed in it, so when it's windy or the leaves fall off, they are often replanted somewhere close by.</p>

      <h3>What a fern needs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Moist soil with routine watering- they are native to more humid climates! However, they don't need a lot of water. Just moist soil</li>
        <li>Ferns love the sun! They love about 4 hours of sunlight a day</li>
        <li>When fertilizing your plants, probably once every 6 months, use a 20-10-20 to make sure appropriate nutrients are recieved.</li>
      </ol>
